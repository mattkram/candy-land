    "# On Candy Land\n",
    "\n",
    "My three-year-old son was given \"Candy Land\" as a Christmas gift this year (thank's Aunt Marianne), and he has been obsessed with it ever since. Those of you with young children will know how this goes. It suffices to say that, given the combination of homeschooling due to the pandemic and this *wonderful* gift, I have been playing roughly at least 20+ games of Candy Land (TM) a day since Christmas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, owing either to the insanity caused by such a predicament, or my genuine interest in statistics, I have begun to wonder about the statistical nature of this game.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those unfamiliar, Candy Land is a board game consisting of a \"road\" of colored spaces, and the objective is to reach King Kandy's Castle first.\n",
    "There are no dice. The way you move is you draw a colored card from a deck, which contains a total of 44 cards. There are four special cards which send you directly to a certain space. The remainder of the cards consist of a color (orange, green, purple, red, yellow, & blue), and a value of one or two.\n",
    "For each color, there are generally four single-square cards and three double-square cards. Except for red and purple, which for some reason contain only three single-square cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the board and the cards:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "    <tr>\n",
    "        <td><img src=\"board.jpg\" alt=\"Candy Land Board\" style=\"width: 300px;\"/></td>\n",
    "        <td><img src=\"cards.jpg\" alt=\"Candy Land Board\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/></td>\n",
    "    </tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules are very simple, which makes it great for 3+ year-olds (and apparently 34-year-old Ph.D. engineers ...\n",
    "\n",
    "The cards are first shuffled.\n",
    "The youngest player moves first.\n",
    "Players take turns drawing a card from the deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For a colored-square card, the player moves forward to the next, or second-to-next squares of that color. If that square is occupied, the player moves to the following square of that color.\n",
    "* If a pink special card is drawn, the player moves forward or backwards, directly to that special location on the board.\n",
    "* There are two \"licorice\" spots. If a player lands on this spot, they lose their next turn.\n",
    "* There are two special spots, which provide shortcuts forward via either a river or a strip of candy paper. These are indicated in the photo by an arrow at the first blue square, or the third green square.\n",
    "* The first player to reach King Kandy's Castle (which is the final spot that can be reached with a card of any color) wins"

    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing I noticed is that the game is purely deterministic, in the sense that once the cards are shuffled, the fates are settled.\n",
    "Don't tell my son this, as playing through this inevitable fate is all the fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing I noticed is that children can figure out very young that cheating helps.\n",
    "I found my son stacking the deck to give himself the Ice Cream Cone, or even a single blue square to catch the river shortcut.\n",
    "This led to some moral teaching opportunities, which was definitely unexpected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I noticed that, even when I ensured a fair shuffle, my son would go on winning runs of 5-6 games pretty frequently.\n",
    "My initial assumption was that, for a two-person game, there would be a roughyl 50% chance of each player winning.\n",
    "However, it may be possible that the player with the starting draw has a higher probability of winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these questions, and the fact that one of my favorite things in the world is applying complex tools to completely trivial problems, I set about to simulate the game to study the statistical properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Herein lies that investigation."
